*** /    
Contains everything , don't do 
#+begin_src shell
rm -rf /
#+end_src
*** /dev 
Contains device and io files, your usb devices, serial connections, spi connections communicate with linux through these. Might need to play around with permissions here on occasion
the vaunted stdout/stdin files live here
*** /etc
Contains system configuration files 
  the hosts(ip masks and stuff) sudoers(who has what administrative privaleges) files are here along with lots of others, such as many systemwide systemD scripts
*** /opt
Ros lives here once installed. opt is kind of like an appendix. most user software is installed in /usr/local{/share}
*** /usr
 most system software , your linux utilities, c++ stl headers, etc live here
**** /bin 
where the executables live
**** /lib 
where the linkables live
**** /include
where the headers lives 

*** /usr/local
Where globally available user-level software lives ( in theory ) 
**** tldr /bin /lib /include

** Users , Permissions
